    <p>I am a twenty-six year old man from Idaho, USA, and working with technology has been my dream since i was a child. 
       Growing up we didn't have much money, so as result I never even thought i could follow those dreams, and thought i 
       was destined for blue collar careers, of which i had no interest. This year however, a friend of me encouraged me 
       to finally follow my dreams, and i found the site of <a draggable=true><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a></a>  
       where i was able to invest in not only a full-stack web developement course, but also myself!

        Being the quick study that i am, here is where i am at; i am fluent in html, and familiar with CSS as well as Python. 
        As i progress along my programming journey i will update this page, and will continue to add new credentials as i build new strengths!
        As i said, i am a very savy and capable person, i learn very quick, so be sure to check back often to see what new skills i have added.
        Perhaps you will find a skill of mine to meet your needs!

        Thank you for checking me out, i hope you consider me for YOUR next project.
